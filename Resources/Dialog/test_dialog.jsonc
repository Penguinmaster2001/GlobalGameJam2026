// Suspicion goes up to 10.
// There are 4 masks (no mask, level 1, level 2, level 3).
// The game is top down 2d with free movement.
// A single interaction trigger is able to hold several interactions, if one fails (e.g. the player is wearing the wrong mask or hasn't completed required interactions, or the interaction has been repeated it's max amount of times), then the next one is tried. This allows, for example, the upper cultist to trigger a different interaction based on the mask the player is wearing.
// Empty lists in requirements mean no requirements, "mask" and "current_objective" must match one item in the lists, and "completed_objectives" and "previous_interactions" must match all.
// Interactions start with dialog_id 0, and end when dialog_id -1 is chosen with a response.
// Actions are usually run at the end of a dialog.
